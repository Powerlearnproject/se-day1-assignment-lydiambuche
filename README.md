#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering refers to the application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software.
importance of software engineering in the technology industry  
Reliability 
It ensures software is robust, secure, and performs well.  
Scalability 
It helps build systems that can grow with user demands.  
Efficiency 
Software engineering Streamlines development, reducing costs and time-to-market.  
Collaboration 
Software engineering provides clear processes for teams to work together effectively


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
NATO Conference
1968 was the birth of software engineering as a discipline to address the “software crisis.”  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1970-1980)
Introduced concepts like classes and inheritance, making code more modular and reusable.  
Agile Manifesto (2001)
Agile manifesto shifted the industry towards iterative, customer-focused development practices.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
1. Planning phase
This phase involves defining the project scope, goals, and feasibility.  
2. Requirement Analysis phase
It involves gathering and documenting user and system requirements.  
3. Design Phase
It involves Creating system architecture and technical specifications.  
4. Implementation
It involves Writing, building, and compiling the code.  
5. Testing
Activities in this phase include detecting and fixing bugs through various testing methods.  
6. Deployment
The product is now released to users. 
7. Maintenance
It involves Updating, optimizing, and supporting the software over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. 
Waterfall methodology 
It is a sequential approach with distinct, fixed phases. It is best for projects with stable, well-defined requirements (e.g.infrastructure software). 
It is appropriate in building medical records system.
Agile methodology has an iterative, flexible approach with continuous feedback. Ideal for evolving products (e.g., mobile apps, web services).  
a good example is a social media platform.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-Writes, tests, and maintains code.  
Quality Assurance Engineer-Identifies bugs and ensures product quality through systematic testing.  Project Manager -Oversees timelines, budgets, and team coordination to meet project objectives.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.  
(IDEs) (Integrated Development Environments): 
They enhance productivity with features like code suggestions, debugging, and build automation.
Examples include Visual Studio and intelliJ 
(VCS)Version Control Systems support collaboration, and prevent version conflicts.
Examples include Github and Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common Challenges and Solutions in Software Engineering:**  
Constant change of requirements- Use Agile practices to accommodate evolving needs.  
Technical debts- it can be solved by Scheduling regular refactoring and code reviews.  
Team miscommunication- can be avoided by Fostering clear, frequent communication with stand-ups and collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Jira).


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing
Tests individual components for correctness.
Integration Testing
Ensures different modules work together.  
System Testing 
Verifies the entire system's functionality.  
Acceptance Testing
Confirms the software meets business and user requirements.  

Thorough testing reduces post-release issues, ensuring a smoother user experience and lower maintenance costs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise, well-structured inputs to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant responses. It’s essential for harnessing the full potential of AI systems.
- Helps AI understand user intent more accurately.  
- Reduces irrelevant or incorrect outputs.  
- Enhances productivity when using AI for tasks like content creation, code generation, or data analysis.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a vague prompt is "Tell me about software"

 an Improved Prompt 
"Explain what software is, including the differences between system and application software. Provide examples of each and describe their functions."
Improved prompt is effective since it is clear, detailed and focused.
